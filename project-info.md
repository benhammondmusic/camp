  three lists in your board:<br> - **Ice Box**<br> - **Current/MVP**<br> - **Completed**<br>
  <br>**User Stories** must follow the following template:<br>**_As a \<user role\>, I want \<feature\>, because \<reason\>._**<br>The _reason_ is optional if it's blatantly obvious.
  <br><br>Note: Prioritize your user stories within the Ice Box with your "wish
